# ESPHome Project Cursor Rules

## Python Environment
- Always activate the ESPHome Python virtual environment before running first commands in terminal
- Use: `c:/Users/sergei/Documents/esphome/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`
- This ensures the correct ESPHome version and dependencies are available

## ESPHome Compilation
- To compile any ESPHome project, use: `esphome compile <yml_file>`
- Example: `esphome compile reflow-controller/reflow-controller.yml`
- Always run from the main esphome directory (C:\Users\sergei\Documents\esphome)

## Project Structure
- ESPHome configurations are in subdirectories (e.g., reflow-controller/, nibe-controller/)
- Each project has its own .yml configuration file
- Common configurations are shared via common.yaml, common2.yaml, etc.
- Custom components are in components/ subdirectories
